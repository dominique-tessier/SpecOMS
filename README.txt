|                            1.1 What is SpecOMS ?                             |
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
|                                                                              |
|   SpecOMS is an Open Modification Search  software designed for rapid        |
|   identification of important datasets of experimental spectra produced      |
|   through tandem mass spectrometry.                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   If you use SpecOMS, please do cite the following work: SpecOMS: Rapid      |
|   interpretation of discovery proteomics experiments with an open            |
|   modification search strategy, M.David, G.Fertin, H.Rogniaux.               |
|                                                                              |

|                            1.2 SpecOMS advantages                            |
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
|                                                                              |
|   SpecOMS exhibits two major advantages in comparison with other existing    |
|   approaches that do not use a preliminary mass filter:                      |
|       - the software is very efficient and can propose identifications for   |
|         thousands of experimental spectra using a reference database         |
|         containing hundreds of thousands of spectra within a few minuts.     |
|       - as the search neighborhood remains the same for any spectra the      |
|         FDR can be reliably estimated for modified peptides.                 |
|                                                                              |

|                            1.3 SpecOMS limitations                           |
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
|                                                                              |
|   The major known limitation in the use of SpecOMS is the quality of the     |
|   experimental dataset. Indeed consistent and reliable matching can only     |
|   be reliably achieved wwhen experimental data have been acquired using      |
|   a high-accuracy tandem mass spectrometer to achieve the best possible      |
|   accuracy for the ion fragments.                                            |
|                                                                              |
|   SpecOMS has been developped and tested under Windows7 64bits with java     |
|   SE 8, compatibility with another operating system or configuration may     |
|   exist but is not ensured.                                                  |
|                                                                              |

********************************************************************************

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
|                            2.1 prerequisites                                 |
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
|                                                                              |
|   SpecOMS has been developped and tester under a windows7 64bits             |
|   environment. Compatibility with other operating systems or windows         |
|   versions might exist but is not ensured.                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   The algorithm has been developped using functions available only in        |
|   java 1.8. It is therefore necessary for the user to have a Java Runtime    |
|   Environment compatible with java 1.8 (preferably 64bits).                  |
|                                                                              |
|   The Java Standard Environment 1.8 for windows can be found at the          |
|   following url:                                                             |
|                                                                              |

|   SpecOMS  should  preferably be used  on a server  version of the jvm for   |
|   efficiency  purposes. However, it  can be executed on a standard version   |
|   with no major drawback by removing the  -server parameter in the command   |
|   line instruction.                                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   To simply execute SpecOMS from the provided execution script you need to   |
|   ensure the presence of java into the path variable of your operating       |
|   system. For more information, consult the following url:                   |

|   No specific installation is required for the execution of SpecOMS once     |
|   the prerequisite are met. The software is immediately executable from      |
|   the .jar file available in the archive. The user should however first      |
|   configure the parameters in the joint files as explained thereafter.       |
|                                                                              |

|                                                                              |
|   Two configuration files are provided with SpecOMS . Their presence and     |
|   correct syntax is a mandatory requirement for a proper execution of the    |
|   software. In case of an obvious malfunction of the software, the user      |
|   should first ensure that those requirements are met.                       |
|                                                                              |
|   In case of doubts, a minimal example of the configuration files can be     |
|   obtained executing the generate_config_files.bat script present into       |
|   the archive. Parameters and paths files values can then be adjusted by     |
|   the user to fit its needs.                                                 |

|      the charge value for experimental spectra as the higher the charge      |
|      is, the more (and less accurate) peaks the spectrum contains,           |
|      increasing the risk of producing a spurious match for this spectrum.    |

|      Value of the decimal used for the framgent ion mass accuracy. Leads     |
|      to the insertion of the exact mass value m and all supplementary        |
|      masses between m-x and m+x.                                             |
|                                                                              |
|   The combination of the parameters numberofDecimals and decimalValue        |
|   should be as close as possible to the fragment ion accuracy used for the   |
|   acquisition of the experimental dataset processed using the software       |
|   suite. For example if the experimental spectra dataset has                 |
|   been acquired with a fragment ion accuracy of 0.04Da, the parameter        |
|   numberOfDecimals should be set to 2 (multiplication by 100 top reach an    |
|   integer value) and the decimal value to 4 in order to ensure the proper    |
|   support of the accuracy by the software. A dataset acquired with an        |
|   accuracy of 0.5Da on the fragment ion masses leads to the following        |
|   paramters: numberOfDecimals=1 and decimalValue=5. One should notice        |
|   however that the extended search space for each spectrum might lead to     |
|   an important number of spurious fragment mass collisions in the case of    |
|   an unsufficient accuracy at the level of the data acquisition.             |
|                                                                              |

|   following parameters in the command line:                                  |

|       not own at least 4GB of memory, in which case this SpecOMS might       |
|       be considerably slow down).                                            |

|   Note that those command line arguments are not available for all JVMs      |
|   and therefore the user should stick to the oracle JVM version.             |
|                                                                              |
|   In case the user does not want to add this version of the virtual          |
|   machine to its operating system path, the command line can still be        |
|   executed prefixing the "java" keyword with the absolute path of the JVM    |
|   on the user's operating system.                                            |

|   The database source file is organised as a sequence of proteins            |
|   following each other.                                                      |

|   The first line of a protein is constituted of any sequence of caracters    |
|   needed by the user to reference the protein, starting with the caracter    |
|   '>'.                                                                       |

|   On the second line and all the next until another caracter '>' comes the   |
|   amino acid sequence forming the protein. Characters representing the       |
|   amino acids should be conventionnal characters for the representation of   |
|   amino-acids and should not be split by any kind of separator. The          |
|   sequence can be split on multiple line or kept on a single one without     |
|   affecting the behaviour of SpecOMS.                                        |

|   The contaminant file is formatted in the same way as the database source   |
|   file. If the user does not want to include contaminants in the             |

|   After those information and before the end of the spectrum segment come    |
|   peak mass and intensity values expressed as a pair of floating point       |
|   values as follow : 114.0781 2261.7. Values of mass and intensity must be   |
|   separed by a space and each peak must be written on its very own line.     |
|                                                                              |
|   Experimental spectra can be written one after each other or separed by     |
|   a blank line. An example file containing a few spectra is given in the     |
|   archive to help the user if needed. Alternative mgf syntax might work      |
|   but the correctness of the result is not ensured.                          |

|   The result of SpecOMS execution is stored in the result file indicated     |
|   by the user as a collection of PSM, one on each line.                      |
|                                                                              |
|   For a given PSM, multiple values are displayed separated by semicolumn     |
|   as explained thereafter. The first line of the result file displays a      |
|   tag for each value so that the user can identify them easily.              |
|                                                                              |
|      spectrumID: the spectrum identifier, composed of the name of the        |
|      dataset and the scan number                                             |
|                                                                              |
|      peptide: the peptide sequence associated by SpecOMS to this spectrum    |
|                                                                              |
|      sharedMassesBeforeSpecFit: the number of masses shared between the      |
|      spectrum and the peptide before potential execution of SpecFit          |
|                                                                              |
|      sharedMassesAfterSpecFit: the number of masses shared between the       |
|      spectrum and the peptide after execution of SpecFit, should be          |
|      identical or greater than the previous value                            |
|                                                                              |
|      massDeltaLocation: location of the mass delta into the peptide          |
|      sequence to achieve the number of shared masses after SpecFit. Starts   |
|      at 0, this value is -1 if SpecFit did not improved the number of        |
|      shared masses                                                           |
|                                                                              |
|      observedMassDelta: value of the observed delta in dalton                |
|                                                                              |
|      affix: prefix or suffix sequence in case of the detection of a          |
|      missed cleavage peptide. The sequence is give between parentheses and   |
|      preceded repectively by Pref or Suff. This field is leaved blank if     |
|      there is no missed cleavage                                             |
|                                                                              |
|      cutSide: indicates a potential side on which the peptide is             |
|      truncated; the missing part is on left is the value is -1 and on        |
|      right if the value is 1 and the length of the missing sequence can be   |
|      deduced from the field massDeltaLocation. If the value is 0, then       |
|      this peptide is not a semi-tryptic peptide.                             |
|                                                                              |
|      chargeError: indicates a potential charge state error if the value is   |
|      1, it should be 0 otherwise.                                            |
|                                                                              |
